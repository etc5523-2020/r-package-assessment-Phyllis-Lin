The goal of phyllispkg is to run phyllis shinyapp relative to COVID-19.
The data that was used for all visualizations are provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) who pulled their data on a public [Github page]( https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and Rami Krispin and other 4 contributor provided a tidy format of the data that named [coronavirus]( https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus). As the dataset were too large that I only choose 10 main countries that have severe outbreak and select the data from 22nd Jan to 31st Jul 2020. The data set have 7 variables contained data, province in some countries, longitude, latitude and cases number of three different types. 


## Installation

You can install the released version of phyllispkg from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("phyllispkg")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-Phyllis-Lin")
```

## Further explortation about the Shinyapp

For further exploration about the shinyapp, I wrote a post can be found here
[covidpost](https://peimin-lin-blog.netlify.app/post/blog-3/)


## Example

To launch the app:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(phyllispkg)
launch_app()
```


<p>
    <img src="man/figures/plot.png"/>
</p>




## Exported Function


This is a basic example which shows you how to create a leaflet map:

```r 
library(phyllispkg)
data("map") ## data in package
leaf_output(type_choose = Type, date_choose = Date)
```

```{r external-image, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='middle'}
# adding the figure from COVID-19 Dashboard
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/leafmap.png")
```
